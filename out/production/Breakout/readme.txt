The game will start and launch the ball once you press up arrow.

You can move the paddle by the left and right arrow, and the mouse.

A block will change color or disappear if one get hit by the ball, while some
blocks need extra hit to be destroyed.

You lose if the ball hit the bottom edge. You win if all the blocks disappear.
